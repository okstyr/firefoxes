# firefoxes
manage multiple independant firefox profiles

## DONE
- `ff-clone`  makes a copy from default
- `ff-rm`     deletes a copy
- `ff-name`   makes a background image from name of clone
- incorporate tab hack into userChrome.css
  - tabs are multirow
  - background image (like a theme) has name of 'mega-profile'


  ## TODO

  ### important
  - make auto-clone on non-existing 'profile'

  ### even less important
  - make up name for 'profile'
  - consider having multiple defaults/sources (eg different versions) and choosing which one to clone
