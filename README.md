# firefoxes
manage multiple independant firefox profiles

## DONE
- `ff-clone`  makes a copy from `default` or from source specified
- `ff-rm`     deletes a copy
- `ff-name`   makes a background image from name of clone
- incorporate tab hack into userChrome.css
  - tabs are multirow
  - background image (like a theme) has name of 'mega-profile'


  ## TODO

  ### important
  - make auto-clone on non-existing 'profile'
    - this is on hold till i decide if i really want it
  - consider making up a naming convention like `foo-bar` - will launch if `foo-bar` exists otherwise
    will clone `foo-bar` from `foo`
  ## not so important
  - round those tab corners!
  ### even less important
  - make up name for 'profile'
